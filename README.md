JS game for Thrive DX Software Development Bootcamp.

using https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae/ for reference and ideas on how to code.

using https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/creating-a-memory-card-game-with-html-css-and-javascript-57g1 as more inspiration on code and styling.

in playgroud 2, I used the Fisher Yates shuffle algorithm.

I plan on rewriting completely based on what I learn from the two tutorials.

Plan:

- create grid for cards
- place cards
- style grid
- style cards
- create function to flip cards
- creat function to shuffle cards(probable use fisher yates)
- create function to judge if cards match and hold if they do, reset if they don't
- create score increase function within card flip function
- create start/reset button/function

JS game for Thrive DX Software Development Bootcamp.

using https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae/ for reference and ideas on how to code.

using https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/creating-a-memory-card-game-with-html-css-and-javascript-57g1 as more inspiration on code and styling.

in playgroud 2, I used the Fisher Yates shuffle algorithm.

I plan on rewriting completely based on what I learn from the two tutorials.

Plan:

- create grid for cards - done
- place cards - done
- style grid - done
- style cards - done
- create function to flip cards - done
- creat function to shuffle cards(probable use fisher yates) - done(with easier function)
- create function to judge if cards match and hold if they do, reset if they don't - done
- create score increase function within card flip function - done
- create start/reset button/function - done, start only

extras

- create turns counter - done
- create function to display "you won" graphic when game is won
- create function to display "you lost" when player reaches maximum number of turns
- create function to play card flip sound when cards are flipped

citation:

cards were made in canva, all graphics are from canva.
